#circum_circuit
To implement a zkSNARK circuit that proves you know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output, we'll use the circom programming language to define the circuit and then use ZoKrates to generate the proof and verification keys. Finally, we'll deploy a verifier smart contract on-chain to verify the proofs generated by the zkSNARK circuit.

## Description
This project implements a logical gate circuit using the circom programming language. The circuit implements the following truth table:
A B X Y Q

0 0 0 1 1

0 1 0 0 0

1 0 0 1 1

1 1 1 0 1

##Project Rubric
To successfully complete the Final Challenge, your project should:

Write a correct circuit.circom implementation
Compile the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries
Generate a proof using inputs A=0 B=1
Deploy a solidity verifier to Goerli Testnet
Call the verifyProof() method on the verifier contract and assert output is true
